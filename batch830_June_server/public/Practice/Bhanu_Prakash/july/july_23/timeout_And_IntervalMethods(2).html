										now it is as variable-------------->If we want to display this function[displayWelcomeMsg] after some delay it should be as variable	*/

			console.log("It is done");	//in above step 5000milli seconds ------> 5 seconds i.e..,it is displayed after 5 seconds


			//Now why wasting memory by creating another variable, we define and call in same place.
