			Function is grouping of relevant set of instructions whereas array is grouping of heterogeneous Data.
			But there are some limitations for Arrays where its accessing/handling brings confusion. 

			But limitation is not adding multiple students or other its reading by unknown users is difficult.

			var empName = "Bhanu";
			var salary = 10000;

			var stdData = [25, 'male', [34, 48, 71], 0, 0, "Badri"];	//so here we grouped student details in one Array
			for(var i = 0; i < stdData[3].length; i++){
				stdData[4] += stdData[3][i] ;
			}

			stdData[5] = stdData[4] / stdData[3].length;

			console.log("name is : " + stdData[0]);
			console.log("age is : " + stdData[1]);
			console.log("gender is : " + stdData[2]);
			console.log("total is : " + stdData[4]);
			console.log("avg is : " + stdData[5]);
			 //see if array one value is disturbed, data confuses and not appropriate(for correction also).  *****observe output****
			 //limitation is array(only it has index) it cannot store nothing with data but in JSON we have keys.
