CSs 'linear-gradient'

The linear-gradient() is a css function which creates an image consisting of a progressive transition between two or more colors along a stright lines.

Using css3 linear gradients we could add smooth transitions between two or more specified colors.

CSS3 supports two types of linear gradients T

1. Linear Gradients
	These Gradients goes in direction left/right/up/down or diagonally

2.Radial Gradients:

	These Gradients goes to center of container


In order to create a linear gradient for sure we need to add minimum of two color stops which render smooth transitions among. While Adding transition we can even specify starting point or a direction or an angle.


Note:

	linear-gradient has to be added to css 'background-image' property

eg:

	background-image: linear-gradient(red, green)

with direction:

	linear-gradient(to right bottom, blue, pink, yellow);

		direction could be:

			to left
			to right
			to left bottom
			to right top
			to right bottom
			etc.

with direction as angle.

	linear-gradient(60deg, red, blue);


Repeating Linear Gradients:

	background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(red, yellow 5%, blue 4%, pink 4%);

Radial Gradients:

	using which the gradients can be specified with a center
	By Default the radial gradient  shape is ellipse, and position is center, we can still change the positon and shape


	radial-gradient(red, green, blue);
	radial-gradient(red 5%, green 10%, blue 6%);
	radial-gradient(circle, red , green , blue ); // with shape
